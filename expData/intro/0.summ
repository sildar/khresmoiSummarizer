Abstract Zenker ’ s diverticulum is an outpouching of the mucosa through the Killian ’ s triangle due to a default of the cricopharyngeal muscle.
The reference surgical treat - ment including diverticulectomy and section of the cricopha - ryngeal muscle tends to be replaced by rigid or flexible endoscopic treatment.
Endoscopic treatment consists in the section of the wall between the diverticulum and the esopha - gus, and of the cricopharyngeal muscle in it.
For flexible endoscopy, exposure of this wall is best obtained with the help of a flexible diverticuloscope.
The section is done with the help of endoscopic knives and must be limited to the section of the cricopharyngeal muscle or by the diverticu - lum ’ s bottom.
