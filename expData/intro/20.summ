Abstract The development of high resolution manometry has modified the diagnostic approach of esophageal motility disorders.
The use of a high number of electronic sensors together with the pressure variations displayed as esophageal pressure topography have greatly facilitated data interpreta - tion.
The diagnostic yield for dysphagia has increased by 10 â€“ 20 % thanks to these improvements.
The Chicago classification is based on both relaxation of the esophago - gastric junction and the pattern of esophageal contractility.
This diagnostic algorithm allows classifying esophageal motor disorders as achalasia, hypercontractile, or hypocontractile disorders.
