Abstract Eosinophilic esophagitis EE is a recent diagnosis of growing prevalence which must be considered in children and adult patients, more often in male.
EE is a chronic, immune antigen - mediated, and esophageal - limited disease characterized by eosinophil - predominant inflammation.
EE should always be considered in any impaction or dysphagia, but the spectrum of clinical manifestations is broad including manifestations of gastro - esophageal reflux disease resistant to anti - secretory.
The endoscopic appearance alone can be misleading and only histological examination can confirm
the diagnosis by showing infiltration of the esophagus with eosinophils.
