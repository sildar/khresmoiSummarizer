Abstract Despite progress made with vaccination in Morocco, tuberculosis is still a real public health problem.
In the developed countries, this disease is in recrudescence, because of the emergence of risk groups such as HIV patients and immunosuppressed hosts.
Digestive tuber - culosis is common, generally affecting the ileo - caecal area.
However, it is rarely found in the transverse colon.
