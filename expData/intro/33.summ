Abstract The main risk of Barrett ’ s oesophagus is the deve - lopment of adenocarcinoma.
Therefore, endoscopic surveillance is required to detect pre - neoplastic lesions.
Radiofre - quency ablation of oesophagus is a new technique used to destroy superficial tumours as an alternative to surgery.
In France, radiofrequency ablation indication in Barrett ’ s oeso - phagus is due to the presence of high - grade dysplasia without nodular lesion.
After several sessions of radiofrequency, complete response on dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia is excellent, and is achieved in more than 90 % in majority of published studies.
