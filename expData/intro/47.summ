Abstract Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder defi - ned by the absence of propagated contractions aperistalsis in the body of the esophagus and failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter.
Thanks to high resolution mano - metry and study of the esophageal pressure topography, three subtypes, according to the classification of Chicago, have a direct interest in the choice of treatment to use type I of achalasia presents the same result with pneumatic dila - tation 81 % and surgery 85 % type II of achalasia presents the best result with pneumatic dilatation 100 % type III of achalasia called “ spastic ”, which is the more resistant, have the best result with Heller - Dor myotomy 86 %.
More recently appeared the peroral endoscopic myotomy, which remains to study in France, but with the preliminary results, this technic could become the treatment of choice for achalasia, particularly in the type III which is the most resistant.
